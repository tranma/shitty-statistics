Shitty Statistics
=================

"Inspired" by the `statistics` package, but done very shittily. Typically this means when
I don't understand something from `statistics`, I follow the wikipedia article on the topic
and implement it shittily myself.

Good for educational purposes and Easy To Use â„¢. But you might want to consider the `statistics` 
package instead.
